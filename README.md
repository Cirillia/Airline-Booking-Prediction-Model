# Summary
### Overview
I conducted an in-depth analysis of customer flight booking data (50,000 entries, 14 features) using a RandomForest machine learning model. The objective was to predict customer booking completions and extract actionable business insights.

### Key Findings
The model achieved an overall accuracy of 85.62% on the test set, with significant variability in cross-validation scores.
Key predictive features included purchase_lead, length_of_stay, and num_passengers.
The model exhibited high precision for non-bookings but lower precision and recall for actual bookings, indicating potential areas for improvement.

### Business Insights and Recommendations
1. Refined Marketing Strategies
Utilize insights on booking timelines to craft targeted marketing campaigns, reaching customers when they are most likely to book.
2. Enhanced Customer Segmentation
Develop personalized travel packages and offers based on different customer needs, such as family or solo travel preferences, to better cater to various segments.
3. Boosting Ancillary Sales
Increase revenue from ancillary services by understanding and targeting customer preferences for extras like additional baggage, seat selection, and in-flight meals.
4. Customer Experience and Loyalty Programs
Improve customer engagement and loyalty by offering personalized experiences and rewards, aiming to increase repeat bookings and customer retention.
5. Route and Capacity Optimization
Analyze demand patterns to optimize flight routes and capacities, focusing on popular destinations and adjusting offerings for less frequented routes.
6. Investing in Customer Insights
Allocate resources towards gathering and analyzing customer data to continuously refine service offerings and marketing strategies, ensuring they align with evolving customer preferences and behaviors.

### Conclusion
By leveraging customer booking data, these strategies aim to enhance marketing effectiveness, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize operational decisions, ultimately driving increased revenue and growth.
